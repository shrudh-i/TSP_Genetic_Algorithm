# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Using a Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solved using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.

## Features
- Genetic Algorithm implementation to solve the TSP.
- Random initialization of populations.
- Fitness function based on tour length.
- Selection, crossover, and mutation operators to evolve the population.
- Visualization of the TSP solution with city routes and distances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries (install using `pip`):
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shrudh-i/TSP_Genetic_Algorithm.git
   cd TSP_Genetic_Algorithm
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Program

1. Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python tsp_genetic_algorithm.py
2. The program will display the optimized TSP route and its total distance.

#### Parameters
You can modify the genetic algorithm parameters in the script to suit your needs:

- Population Size: Number of solutions in each generation.
- Number of Generations: Total number of generations to evolve.
- Mutation Rate: Probability of mutating a solution.

### How It Works
- Initialization: A population of random tours is generated.
- Evaluation: The fitness of each tour is calculated based on its total distance.
- Selection: The best tours are selected to create the next generation.
- Crossover: New tours are generated by combining parts of parent tours.
- Mutation: Random changes are applied to some tours to maintain diversity.
- Iteration: Steps 2–5 are repeated for a fixed number of generations or until convergence.
